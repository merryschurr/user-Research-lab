# User Research Lab

## I MUST HAVE:

1. Survey used
2. Responses to the survey (2)
3. A short pitch for your idea

## What you need to do:

You'll need to conduct User research on a your chosen project 3 space:

1. Pick the website/app/online service that could be improved
2. Write at least 10 questions that could be used to analyze your site
3. Use those questions to interview at least 2 people (non-classmates) about your site
4. Write a quick summary/pitch (could be written, visual, mockup, etc) that describes - based on your research 5. what issues there are with your competitor, and how you can improve them.

## Factors to consider in picking Users for testing

1. Internal/External - Personal history, mood, Location, relationships
2. Goals and tasks - what are they trying to accomplish?
3. Habits - What services to they commonly use? Are they part of your target demographic?
4. Access - how are they accessing your service? Device, OS, phsical location, etc
5. When - Is there a certain time of day or location in which they use the service?

## User Interviews

1. Consider what you need to know about your subject, and start your questions there.
2. Prepare your questions ahead of time, but use it as a script, not a guide.
3. Ask about actual behavior, not intention
4. Avoid leading questions
5. Try to interview your users while they USE the service - you'll be able to make observations about how they use the app that can't be verbalized.

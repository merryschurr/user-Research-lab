# User Research Lab

## I MUST HAVE:

1. Survey used
2. Responses to the survey (2)
3. A short pitch for your idea

## What you need to do:

You'll need to conduct User research on a your chosen project 3 space:

1. Pick the website/app/online service that could be improved
2. Write at least 10 questions that could be used to analyze your site
3. Use those questions to interview at least 2 people (non-classmates) about your site
4. Write a quick summary/pitch (could be written, visual, mockup, etc) that describes - based on your research 5. what issues there are with your competitor, and how you can improve them.

## Factors to consider in picking Users for testing

1. Internal/External - Personal history, mood, Location, relationships
2. Goals and tasks - what are they trying to accomplish?
3. Habits - What services to they commonly use? Are they part of your target demographic?
4. Access - how are they accessing your service? Device, OS, phsical location, etc
5. When - Is there a certain time of day or location in which they use the service?

## User Interviews

1. Consider what you need to know about your subject, and start your questions there.
2. Prepare your questions ahead of time, but use it as a script, not a guide.
3. Ask about actual behavior, not intention
4. Avoid leading questions
5. Try to interview your users while they USE the service - you'll be able to make observations about how they use the app that can't be verbalized.

My project was based off of the idea of weather apps. What people liked, what people didn’t like, and what apps they use the most. 

How often do you use your weather app?

What time of day do you use your app the most?

What is biggest reason you use your app? 

What is the first thing you usually check on the app?

How often do you want to see detailed information about the current days weather? Example, the weather broken down hour by hour? Or when it will start raining/snowing?

How often do you want to see the next days weather broken down hour by hour?

How often do you check the weather in other city or states other than your home address?

How often do you want to search by specific time? Example, 10am tomorrow morning. 

How often do you want to share the weather with someone  else? Maybe someone coming into town asking what clothes to pack?

How often would you like road conditions due to weather?
